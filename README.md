# Periodic Noise Cancellation
## Overview

The idea of this MATLAB project is to convert the noisy image to the frequency domain using Fourier transform, and then allow the user to determine the places where he finds the spike and then the program covers these points with black spots, and thus when re-creating the image, the image will be almost free from periodic noise.
